# CarDamage_Detection

The objective is to develop and implement a deep learning model that classifies car images to determine whether a car is damaged or not.  By leveraging a labeled dataset of car images, the model is trained to distinguish between damaged and undamaged cars and categorize them as either damaged(0) or whole(1).

This automated classification system is designed to enhance efficiency and accuracy in applications such as insurance claims processing, vehicle inspections, and automated damage assessment, ultimately providing a reliable tool for detecting car damage.

## Dataset
* The images in the dataset are collected from various sources, including insurance company databases, vehicle inspection reports, and publicly available car images.
* The dataset includes a diverse range of car models, colors, and types, ensuring robustness and generalizability of the model.
* Each image in the dataset is manually labeled by experts to ensure accuracy. The labels indicate whether a car is damaged (0) or whole (1).
* Damage categories include minor dents, scratches, broken parts, and severe damage. For simplicity, the labels are binary (0 for damaged, 1 for whole).
* The dataset is organized into two main directories: validation and Training. Each directory is divided into two sub categories: Damaged and Whole. Each contains a large number of images corresponding to the respective category.
